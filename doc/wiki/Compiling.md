## Dependencies

The following packages are required for building.  Since most desktops offer these libraries through package repositories, we recommend using the [Dependency Quickstart](#dependencies-quickstart) for most purposes.

If you get stuck, please ask in the `#support` channel on [Discord](https://lmms.io/chat).

If a package is not available for your platform, you may need to [manually install](#dependencies-detailed).

### Dependencies Quickstart
Recommended.  Each platform requires a [compiler](#compiler) and several [libraries](#libraries).  We've selected the most common settings for you.

| Ubuntu | Debian | Fedora | openSUSE | Arch | macOS | Windows |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| [Qt5](dependencies-ubuntu#qt5), [Qt4](dependencies-ubuntu#qt4) | [Qt5](dependencies-debian#qt5), [Qt4](dependencies-debian#qt4) | [Qt5](dependencies-fedora#qt5),[Qt4](dependencies-fedora#qt4) | [Qt5](dependencies-opensuse#qt5), [Qt4](dependencies-opensuse#qt4) | [Qt5](dependencies-arch) | [Qt5](dependencies-macos#qt5), [Qt4](dependencies-macos#qt4-macos) | [crosscompile](dependencies-windows#ubuntu-cross-compile), [msys2](dependencies-windows#windows-os), [MSVC](dependencies-windows#msvc) |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... platform missing?  Add it [here](Dependencies-FooBar).

### Dependencies Detailed
Alternately, you may download and compile each dependency manually.  This is recommended for advanced users only.

## Clone Source Code
Before preparing the build environment, you must have a [`branch`](../branches) copy of the source code*.
```bash
# clone the "master" branch (e.g. "stable-1.2", etc)
git clone --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/lmms/lmms
```
   > \* Advanced users may prefer to download a tarball instead: [zip](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/archive/master.tar.gz) | [tarball](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/archive/master.tar.gz)

For most users, this will create a folder `~/lmms` which can be used for building.  If you're already using `~/lmms` for samples you'll see `path 'lmms' already exists`, use an alternate location e.g. `~/Desktop` and try again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... want to switch branches or fast-forward?  See [[Accessing git repository]].

<br><!-- End Section --><br>



## Build Environment
The [`cmake` toolchain](#build-toolchain) offers several [built-in configuration options](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-variables.7.html).  In addition, LMMS adds several options useful for building.  Below are a list of the most standard options.  We recommend using the [CMake Quickstart](#cmake-quickstart) for most purposes.

### CMake Quickstart
Assumes you've already [installed dependencies](#dependencies-quickstart) and [cloned the source code](#clone-source-code)
1. Prepare `build` and, optionally, the `target` directories
   ```bash
   cd lmms
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. And then choose one of the following...

   #### Running CMake
   ```bash
   # from "lmms/build" directory
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../target/
   ```

   -- OR --

   #### Running CMake for [Windows](dependencies-windows)*
   ```bash
   # from "lmms/build" directory
   ../cmake/build_mingw64.sh
   ```
   > \* For 32-bit,  use `build_mingw32.sh` instead. On `master`, use `build_win64.sh` or `build_win32.sh` respectively.


   **Notes:**
   In case you want to build LMMS with Qt5, see [Using Qt5](#using-qt5).
   On MacOS Mojave (10.14+), adding `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt5)"` to the end of the cmake command will point cmake to Qt5.

### Build Options
| Option* | Description | Common Values |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html) | Install to non-standard (non-root) location.  This is generally preferred, especially for coding, testing and packaging. | `../target` |
| [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html?highlight=cmake_prefix_path) | Set your Qt5 (probably other library too) installation path if it does not reside in standard installation paths | `/path/to/qt5` |
| [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html) | Force build to include debugging or optimization symbols | `Release`, `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo` |
| [`FORCE_VERSION`](../blob/master/cmake/modules/VersionInfo.cmake) | Force version within software, useful for distributing one-off packages | `internal`, `1.2.3-myfix` |
| [`PLUGIN_LIST`](../blob/master/plugins/CMakeLists.txt) | Limit build only to the specified [`/plugins/`](../blob/master/plugins/), used to reduce compile time, such as when [bisecting](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) | `"audio_file_processor kicker triple_oscillator"` |
| [`LMMS_MINIMAL`](../blob/master/plugins/CMakeLists.txt) | Same effect as `PLUGIN_LIST`, but auto-selects the core plugins required for most basic testing. | `True` |
| [`WANT_QT5`, `WANT_SDL`, `WANT_SWH`, `WANT_VST`...](../blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) | Toggle on/off a library, dependency or feature | `ON`, `OFF` |


> \* When provided on command line, all [options](#build-options) must be prefixed with `-D`, e.g<br>
> `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`

#### Using Qt5
Note:  These flags are only required for `stable-1.2` branch.  Newer branches (e.g. `master`) use Qt5 by default and Qt4 support has been removed. Skip this section if you're compiling `master`.


In order to build LMMS with Qt5, add the following flag when invoking cmake:

   ```bash
   -DWANT_QT5=ON
   ```

... or if you're using `mingw` and configuring via script, you will provide [`-qt5`](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/blob/stable-1.2/cmake/build_mingw64.sh#L13) as a parameter to the shell script.

   ```bash
   ../cmake/build_mingw64.sh -qt5
   ```

If your Qt5 installation does not reside in standard installation paths, additionally pass e.g.

   ```bash
   -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt5
   # e.g. on Mac, -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt5)"
   ```

## Compiling
Assumes you've already [installed dependencies](#dependencies-quickstart) and [cloned the source code](#clone-source-code) and [configured the build environment](#running-cmake).

   ```bash
   # from "lmms/build" directory
   make -j4
   ```

... and then run by calling:

   ```bash
   ./lmms
   ```

Compilation errors are usually attributed to missing packages, misconfigured system or specific compatibility problems.  Please jump to the appropriate troubleshooting guide:

**Troubleshooting:** [Ubuntu](dependencies-ubuntu#troubleshooting), [Debian](dependencies-debian#troubleshooting), [Fedora](dependencies-fedora#troubleshooting), [openSUSE](dependencies-openSUSE#troubleshooting), [Arch](dependencies-arch#troubleshooting), [macOS](dependencies-macOS#troubleshooting), [Windows](dependencies-windows#troubleshooting)

## Debugging
Debugging LMMS requires a re-run of the `cmake` command, but with the debug symbols turned on.
For a comprehensive tutorial, see also [[Debugging LMMS]]

### Adding Debug Symbols
   ```bash
   # from "lmms/build" directory
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../target/
   # -- OR for better performance --
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../target/
   # re-run the build
   make -j4
   ``` 
### Debugging with `gdb`
Assuming you have `gcc` (most common), you'll need `gdb` installed via `apt-get`, `dnf`, `pacman`, etc.
   ```bash
   gdb lmms
   # or alternately gdb ../target/bin/lmms
   (gdb) run
   # once you hit the crash, CTRL + C
   backtrace full
   ```

### Debugging with `lldb`
Assuming you have `clang` (macOS, FreeBSD), you'll need `lldb` installed via `brew`, `pkg_add`, etc.
   ```bash
   lldb lmms
   # or alternately lldb ../target/bin/lmms
   # macOS, use `make -j4 install` then `lldb LMMS.app/Contents/MacOS/lmms`
   (lldb) run
   # once you hit the crash, CTRL + C
   thread backtrace full
   ```

## Packaging

| Supported | Format | Platform | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| ✔️       | `.exe` | [Windows](#windows-packaging) | `lmms>=0.4.0` |
| ✔️       | `.dmg` | [macOS](#macos-packaging) | `lmms>=1.0.0` |
| ✔️       | `.AppImage` | [Linux Universal](#linux-packaging) | Work in progress, see [#3688](../issues/3688) |
| ✖️       | `.run` | [Linux Universal](#linux-packaging) | Work in progress, see [#2932](../issues/2932) |
| ❌       | `.deb` | Debian, Ubuntu | See [#1620](../issues/1620). Please contact package maintainers. |
| ❌       | `.rpm` | Fedora, openSUSE | Related to [#1620](../issues/1620). Please contact package maintainers. |

#### Windows Packaging

This is the most common type for getting features and fixes out to a large number of testers. Assumes you've already [installed dependencies](#dependencies-windows) and [cloned the source code](#clone-source-code) and [configured the build environment](#running-cmake).  Once completed, the release should be [published](#publishing-a-release) for others to download.
```bash
# from "lmms/build" directory
make package     # package using nsis
```
> Try `explorer .` to see it in Explorer. Produces `lmms-1.2.0.123-win64.exe`, where `123` is the number of commits since stable release.

#### MacOS Packaging

Assumes you've already [installed dependencies](#dependencies-macos) and [cloned the source code](#clone-source-code) and [configured the build environment](#running-cmake).  Once completed, the release should be [published](#publishing-a-release) for others to download.

**Warning:** Must set [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](#build-options) or it will attempt to bundle all of `/usr/local/`.

```bash
# from "lmms/build" directory
make install     # builds the app bundle
make dmg         # creates the disk image using appdmg
open .           # optional: view in Finder

```

> Produces `lmms-1.2.0.123-mac10.11.dmg`, where `123` is the number of commits since stable release and `mac10.11` is the macOS version which the package was built on.

#### Linux Packaging

Assumes you've already [installed dependencies](#dependencies-quickstart) and [configured the build environment](#running-cmake).  Once completed, the release should be [published](#publishing-a-release) for others to download.  This command will fail if `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` was not provided.
```bash
# from "lmms/build" directory
make install     # installs to target
make appimage    # creates a Linux AppImage
```
> Produces `lmms-1.2.0-123-linux-x86_64.AppImage`, where `123` is the number of commits since stable release.

#### Publishing a Release

Using [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), Project administrators may wish to package a release to their personal github account or to the entire project.

* **Personal Release**: Used for distributing early feature or test packages.
   * URL: `https://github.com/tresf/lmms/releases` (replace `tresf` with your `@github` id)
* **Project Release**: Used for distributing official stable and release candidate packages.
   * URL: `https://github.com/lmms/lmms/releases`

> Download statistics are available [here](https://api.github.com/repos/lmms/lmms/releases)
