|Special Labels: | |
|:----------------------|:-----------:|
|![critical](http://i.imgur.com/gR3JsXW.png) |For bugs that need a fix ASAP and are blocking regular development.|
|![needs clarification](http://i.imgur.com/o4a55ha.png)|For poorly written issues that are not understandable / incomplete.|
|![support request](http://i.imgur.com/ZJIT3m9.png)|For issues that aren't really issues, but users reaching out for help.|
|![meta](http://i.imgur.com/mgFrOld.png)|For issues consisting of an amount of smaller issues.|
|![not our bug](http://i.imgur.com/9ZlKNUR.png)|For issues that aren't actually related to LMMS.|
|![duplicate](http://i.imgur.com/DQDJDKW.png)|For issues that already exist.|
|![invalid](http://i.imgur.com/n3UBq52.png)|For non-reproducible issues.|
|![won't fix](http://i.imgur.com/dEJTyvn.png)|Valid issues that won't be addressed, for whatever reason.|

If an issue is valid, confirmed, well written, and within the scope of LMMS, it should be labeled with `bug` or `enhancement`. If it does not match that criteria, that means its either a `support request`, `invalid`, a `duplicate` or it `needs clarification`.

## Prioritization

What is the order in which issues should be solved?

* Issues with the `critical` label are of the highest priority and should be solved as soon as possible.
* Issues that have a milestone have a higher priority than non-milestoned issues. The lower the milestone version number, the higher the priority.
* Bugs have a higher priority than enhancements.
