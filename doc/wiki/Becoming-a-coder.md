## Read and understand

This is the first skill for a coder. You should read all available text and understand it. If you do not understand anything in these guidelines, there may be a problem either on your side or in the guidelines.

The way an individual becomes a coder is personal: you should find your own way eventually. In this process, you should build some skills. Remember this one: read and understand.
