# FindSphinx
# ----------
#
# Try to find the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
# ``Sphinx_FOUND``
#     True if (the requested version of) Sphinx is available
# ``Sphinx_VERSION``
#     The version of the Sphinx documentation builder.
# ``Sphinx_BUILD_EXECUTABLE``
#     The path to the Sphinx documentation builder executable.
#
# If ``Sphinx_FOUND`` is TRUE, it will also define the following imported target:
#
# ``Sphinx::Build``
#     The Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# In general we recommend using the imported target, as it is easier to use.
#
# Since 5.17.0.
